# gta5-custom-properties
Allows creation of custom properties (like apartments and garages) in Grand Theft Auto V.

# Inspiration
This mod is inspired by I'm Not MentaL's Single Player Apartments mod. I didn't like the fact that the apartment/garage locations in their mod are hardcoded, and instead of hoping for custom apartments to be implemented in the mod, I decided to create a new project, based off the original, but in C# instead of Visual Basic and with (hopefully) less messy but still functional code.
